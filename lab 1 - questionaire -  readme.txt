** QUESTION 1: THOUGHT PROCESS **

    The three main EPICS were the contingencies for the entire website design. "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Pablo Picasso
    The process is roughly explained below each EPIC through their 3 releases. The thought was to start simple and to improve sophistication through each release distinguishing what the company represents, which is an inclusive and diverse company that gives back to its patrons.

**QUESTION 2: DECISION 1: I needed to make sure that no one wasted time picking through things only to find out that they are in the wrong location that has different products. Results are captured through the releases, which focus on customers stating issues through which improvements will be made.**

        1. Location (For accuracy of stock and price):

           +   Release 1:
            - For current stock in that location
            - Nofications for restock
            - Customer opinion

        +   Release 2:
            - Customer opinion on that location

        + Release 3:
            - Not applicable


------------


** Question 3: Decision 2: In order to narrow down stock for the customer and save time and exhaustion we wanted to straight away strike towards their diet/moral preferences (Kosher, Regular (Everything), Halal, vegitarian). Then through each release to advance their searches, options, and rewards.**

        2. Food Order (Options to narrow options: Kosher, Halal, Regular):

        +   Release 1:

            - Actual products for purchase in that location

        +   Release 2:
            - Recommendations
            - Top selling
            - Advanced Search
            - Sale Items
            - Items that recieve extra points

            + Release 3:
            - Compare products
            - Products with extra points


------------ 


** Question 3: Decision 3: Payment options made clear and and easy with the option to add in extra instructions. As releases become available, freedom of accessibility and options for a haste delivery become available, also flexible payment options. **

        3. Payment (Contingencies):

        +  Release 1:
            - Sign-in, sign-up, continue as guest
            - Shipping location
            - Time for delivery (Extra instructions)
