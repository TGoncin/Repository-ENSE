Description/Details:

     Based on data, information, and knowledge gathered from the project discussion, teams will compile project
        insights via affinity diagramming and empathy mapping activities and create a user story mapping illustrating
        key Minimum Viable Products. Teams will also propose site navigations/site maps and produce several 
        low-fidelity interface designs (low technology, i.e. paper and pencil). On the check-in "due" date listed
        above, teams will discuss knowledge gained via the documents below with key customers to confirm project 
        planning activities and envisioned design directions.
